# Dusk's Kritical mod

Kritical Is a Mod To Change the Critical Hit Mechanic In Minecraft 
From **Jump Crits** To **Chance Based Crits**.

These Crits Are Based On Attributes.

So They Can Be Modified Using **Commands** , **Mods** & **Data Packs**.

## Attributes : 

There Are 2 Main Attributes Currently Used By This Mod.

```Kritical:critical_chance  | Default : 0 | Minimum : 0 | Maximum : 200  ```

&

```AdditionalEntityAttributes.CRITICAL_BONUS_DAMAGE | Default : 0.5 | Minimum : -1 | Maximum : 1024```

**I Highly Recommend Using The Mod Alongside Somthing Like[Pufferfish's Skills](https://modrinth.com/mod/skills)**
